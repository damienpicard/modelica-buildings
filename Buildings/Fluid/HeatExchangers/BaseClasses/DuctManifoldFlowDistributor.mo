Documentation(info="<html>
<p>
This model distributes the mass flow rates equally between all instances
of <code>port_b</code>.
</p>
<p>
The model connects the flows between the ports without
modeling flow friction.
The model is used in conjunction with
a manifold that
is added to the other side of the heat exchanger registers.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> It is important that there is an equal pressure drop
in each flow leg between this model, and the model that collects the flows.
Otherwise, no solution may exist. Hence, only use this model if you know
what you are doing.

Reformulated the multiple iterators in the <code>sum</code> function
